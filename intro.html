                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>A Chris, alone, is weak. Chrises together, are strong. That
                        is the founding principle behind our organization. Much like how
                        the colonies banded together to fight off the colonizers during the
                        American War for Independence, so too shall we.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
                    <p>A Chris is, by nature, discriminated against by society. Some might call
                        them society's least priviledged group. We're here to change that. Attend
                        our seminars to see how the most famous Chris's of our time reached their
                        cult-like status.

                    <h2>Why?</h2>
                    <p>Since the days of yore, CoC has been hard at work making life better.
                        Why you may ask? It is our duty. One of our commanding tenents is the
                        helping of the less fortunate. Chris leads by example. If even he, a god
                        among men, may stoop to our level to pay off our student loans, ensure
                        that we have sufficient food to get through the day, and bless our youngest
                        sons by sleeping with them, then it is also up to us, as followers of the
                        almighty Chris, to pay that forward.</p>
